# Exoplanet-Dashboard

🪐 Exoplanet Discovery Data Analysis Dashboard
📊 Overview

This Power BI project visualizes data from NASA’s Exoplanet Archive (via Kaggle) to explore planetary discoveries from 1980 to 2021.
The dashboard provides interactive insights into discovery methods, number of stars per planet, discovery facilities, and yearly discovery trends, helping users understand how modern astronomy detects and catalogs exoplanets across time.

🚀 Key Features

Dynamic Visualizations: Interactive bar, pie, and line charts tracking discovery trends, detection methods, and star systems.

Data Exploration: Filter by distance, discovery year, facility, and detection technique to uncover specific insights.

Analytical Insights:

Over 75% of planets were discovered via the Transit method.

Discovery rates surged post-2010 due to missions like Kepler and K2.

Clean Visual Design: A space-themed Power BI layout that emphasizes clarity and storytelling for scientific datasets.

🧠 Skills & Tools Used

Power BI – data modeling, DAX measures, and report design

Data Cleaning – Power Query and Excel preprocessing

Kaggle Dataset – NASA Exoplanet Archive data

Data Storytelling – presenting complex scientific information visually

💡 Insights Gained

The Transit Method dominates exoplanet detection, especially with satellite-based telescopes.

The number of confirmed exoplanets rose exponentially between 2010–2020, aligning with improvements in optical detection technology.

Facilities like Kepler and La Silla account for the majority of confirmed planetary discoveries.
